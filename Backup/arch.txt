Installing Arch 1st time

use kali live to setup hdd partition using gparted
sda1 as ntfs cuz windows dont recognize other partition if 1st one aint ntfs
sda2 ext4 cuz grub scans through all partitions

reboot
use arch live to setup system


1. check net
ping -c 3 www.google.com

2. mount partition
fdisk -l (to get partition table)
mkdir /mnt
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt

3. Setting mirror for pacman

nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

(Scroll down to your preferred mirror (the closer to your location the better), press Alt+6 to copy the line, then scroll back up and press Ctrl+U to paste that line at the top of the list. US users should already have a good server at the top of the list. When you're done, press Ctrl+X to exit, and save with Y and Enter if you made any changes.)

4.Install the Arch Base System
pacstrap -i /mnt base


5.Fstab stands for File Systems Table. This file lists your available drives and partitions and decides how you'll use each one. To create one for your drive, just run:

genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
nano /mnt/etc/fstab

6. we'll need to chroot into our newly-created system. Essentially, we'll be running a terminal on that system without having booted into it yet. To do this, just run:

arch-chroot /mnt

7.Next, create the locale files by running:

nano /etc/locale.gen

 uncomment the "en_US.UTF-8 line". Again, press Ctrl+X to exit, then Y and Enter to save it.

8.locale.conf file with the following command (for English-speaking US users):

echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

9. Time Zone and Clock

ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Calcutta
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Calcutta /etc/localtime

10. Then, set the clock according to your chosen zone with:

hwclock --systohc --utc


11. Since I am used to wired connection only

systemctl enable dhcpcd
systemctl start dhcpcd



12. Package manager configure but if you're on a 64-bit machine, you should also enable the [multilib] repository, which lets you install both 64- and 32-bit programs. To do so, add the following lines to the bottom of the config file:

nano /etc/pacman.conf


add the following lines to the bottom of the config file:

[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist


13. Update list for pacman

pacman -Sy


14. add password to root

passwd

now enter new password

15. new user

useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power -s /bin/bash username

passwd username


16. Install sudo
pacman -S sudo

make changes to sudo config for wheel users

uncomment, save thingh without password
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

and comment 


17. add grub 

pacman -S grub-bios
grub-install --target=i386-pc --recheck /dev/sda

cp /usr/share/locale/en\@quot/LC_MESSAGES/grub.mo /boot/grub/locale/en.mo

pacman -S os-prober
